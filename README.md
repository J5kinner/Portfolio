# Portfolio
This is my portfolio website using HTML, CSS (SASS) and JS


# Goals
I plan to convert this project into a ReactJS Project and also 
refresh the recent React Projects I have completed and have been apart of. 

# How to run it in VS Code
Use the watch live extension in VS Code 

Also use the watch SASS extension when coding CSS
